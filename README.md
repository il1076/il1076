## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a strong proponent of reproducible methods, open source technologies, and diversity in tech. I am the founder of **[R-Ladies Irvine](https://www.rladiesirvine.org)**, and I'm a member of the **MIT Technology Review** Global Panel.

I love my work and enjoy each new challenge as it arises. Have a look at my **[portfolio and experience](https://alyssacolumbus.com)**, and donâ€™t hesitate to **[contact me](mailto:hello@alyssacolumbus.com)** if you think I can be of service to you.
